# Description

Ambience was a mod for 1.12.2 Minecraft that allowed players to create *music packs*. These music packs would dynamically play music based on the state of the game and your environment - you could set different music for boss fights, the main menu and credits, fishing, certain biomes, and much more. Unfortunately, the mod is no longer maintained - but I chose to fix that by creating this version. The entire mod has been ported to 1.19.2, and I will maintain it to the best of my ability. If there is enough demand, I will consider porting other versions! This port also improves and modernises a few parts of the mod. Check the [wiki](https://github.com/cursedgerbil/AmbiencePlus/wiki) for more information.
